# Using Weather Report

### If you do not have Rails or Ruby installed on your computer, do the following:
  * Check out https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ for instructions on how to install ruby
  * Check out http://installrails.com/ for instructions on how to install rails
    * I would recommend using rbenv for both if you use a Mac or Ubuntu

 ## Once completed follow the steps below

### If you have the ability to use git:
  * Click on the Clone or Download button (the big green one) and click on the clipboard.
  * Open terminal and navigate to the desired directory and put 'git clone <clone link here>' without the quotes.
  * Using terminal again - cd into weather_app
  * Enter 'make server' into the terminal, again without quotes.
  * Open Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser and navigates to 'localhost:3000'


###  If you do not have git:
  * Click on the Clone or download button above and click on download.
  * Unzip the folder into the desired location and open terminal.
  * Open terminal and navigate to the root of the project
  * Enter 'make server' into the terminal without quotes
  * Open Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser and navigates to 'localhost:3000'


After that, the website itself should lead you through the entire process.
